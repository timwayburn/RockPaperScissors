# Projinda-16
Projekt till Projindan 16 - Tim Wayburn/ Philippa Ã–rnell

Our first attempt ever to create a simple JavaFX program. (Warning for sloppiness).
It is a button based Rock Paper Scissors game. Works best with sounds!

To run the game:

1. Download the repository.
2. Compile and run the app.Main.java file in IDE. (Import project)
    Note: Don't forget to mark the "Resources" folder as a resource folder.
3. Have fun!

We will create JUnit tests for certain methods as well as conduct user tests as soon as we have a working game.
